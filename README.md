### chatbot_levels_of_complexity
This repo contains chatbots of three levels of complexity, obtained from chatGPT, then rewritten by me. This is for the purpose of my learning and understanding related to creating chatbots of various levels.

# Notes/known issues:
* For some reason, on line 48 of 00_simple/train.py and on line 47 of 00_simple/chat.py, the linter shows a typeerror. Despite this, the code runs fine. "# type: ignore" has been added to mute the errors.
